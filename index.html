        #Homework 3: How websites work?
        <h1 id="aboutourteam">About our team</h1>
        <p>
            Our team is Team39. Our group initially consists of 5 people. Our team, consisting 
            of Arif Mammadli, Alsari Mohamed Abbas Saad Eldin, Aysu Rahimli, Jahangir Khalafov and Ilkin Alishov.Unfortunately,
            we could not get in touch with one of the members of our team. Each of our team members started their
            Codeacademy training on their own. After completing the whole course, we began to collaborate through github.
            Some of us was experienced about <em>Web Development</em>.

      <p>My name is Aysu Rahimli. I am a first year student at ADA University. My major is Information Technologies. So far I have learned about so much about programming in C language. Since my childhood I have been interesed in problem solving and I was fond of Mathematics. Nonetheless, I didn't have any experince with HTML and CSS before. Thanks to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codeacademy</a>, I gained a brief knowledge about them. Even though I struggled little bit, it was fun to learn about <strong>Web Programming</strong>.
