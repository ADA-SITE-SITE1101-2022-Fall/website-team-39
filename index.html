            <h1>Hour of Code</h1>

            <p>Our team, consisting of Arif Mammadli, Alsari Mohamed Abbas Saad Eldin, Aysu Rahimli, Jahangir Khalafov and Ilkin Alishov decided to organize an Hour of Code in the school no. 17, situated in the Ahmadli area of Baku on October 15th 2022 at 15:00 for students of 5th grade. Mammadli has contacted the principal and academic staff three days before the event to coordinate the Hour of Code. The school was chosen because of its open-minded administration, adequately developed computer science classes as well as sufficient equipment in computer classrooms. The team (barring Jahangir Khalafov, who did not participate in the event anyhow nor has made any contributions) arrived to the school one hour prior to the event at 14:00 and started making preparations for the event in the computer classroom of the school â€“ opening Classic Maze webpage before the students arrived. During the event Mammadli introduced the ADA University in detail with the aid of slides provided in the homework assignment, Alishov made a speech about the history and joy of programming with his own slides and Rahimli talked about the Hour of Code and Classic Maze game. Eldin was filming the event as well as taking pictures. Team members started helping students struggling with the game after the introductory speeches. Due to the fact that the students had expertise in programming via computer science classes the majority of them played through the game with no issues. After one hour has passed every student has finished the game and were provided with Hour of Code certificates. The students enjoyed the event and thanked the team wholeheartedly, and said that it helped them reinforce their computer science knowledge.</p>

                    Our team is Team39. Our team, consisting of 5 people: Arif Mammadli, Alsari Mohamed Abbas Saad Eldin,
                    Aysu Rahimli, Jahangir Khalafov and Ilkin Alishov.Unfortunately,
                    we could not get in touch with one of the members of our team. Each of our team members started their
                    Codeacademy training on their own. After completing the whole course, we began to collaborate through github.
                    Some of us was experienced about <em>Web Development</em>.

                <p>My name is Aysu Rahimli. I am a first year student at ADA University. My major is Information Technologies.
                    So far I have learned about so much about programming in C language.
                    Since my childhood I have been interesed in problem solving and I was fond of Mathematics.
                    Nonetheless, I didn't have any experince with HTML and CSS before.
                    Thanks to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a>, I gained a brief knowledge about them.
                    Even though I struggled little bit, it was fun to learn about <strong>Web Programming</strong>.

                <p>
                  My name is Ilkin Alishov. It is my second year student at ADA University. Computer Science is my faculty.  
                    Although I started to learn programming with Python, at university I got basics of C language and expanded my programming knowledge. 
                    Technological tools and science have always been in my field of interest. Playing chess and video games, working out, swimming. 
                    It was the first time that I start to learn about Web programming. Codeacademy helped me get information about the fundementals of HTML and CSS.
                    Beginning to learn new things from scratch is always though. It was fun, though.
